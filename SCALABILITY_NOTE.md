My Plan for Production Deployment and Scalability
I built the project using clear modules (routers, schemas, db, utils) specifically to ensure it's easy to maintain and scale in the future. For a real-world deployment and achieving horizontal scaling, here are the steps I would take:

1. Preparing the Environment (Containerization)
I would package the entire application using Docker. This means I could use a production-ready setup like Uvicorn and Gunicorn together inside the container. This step guarantees a consistent environment for everyone who runs the code, eliminating dependency issues across multiple servers.

2. Enhancing Performance (Caching)
I would integrate Redis to improve speed and protect the database. I'd use it primarily for caching frequently accessed data, like user roles or common task lists, which dramatically reduces database load. Crucially, I'd also use Redis for token blacklisting, which allows me to instantly invalidate a user's JWT when they log out, improving security.

3. Distributing Traffic (Load Balancing)
To handle a high volume of users, I would deploy the application behind a load balancer (like Nginx or AWS ALB). This device would automatically distribute incoming user requests evenly across several running container instances of the API, ensuring stability and preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

4. Long-Term Growth (Decoupling)
For maximum future flexibility, I would eventually split the current monolithic API into dedicated Microservices. For example, I'd separate the user management into an Auth Service and the task management into a Task Service. This allows teams to work independently, and we can scale the services individually based on actual demand.
